# **Trends in Indian Tourism Analysis**

## **Overview**

This project explores tourism trends in India between 2014 and 2020, providing insights into visitor demographics, travel methods, seasonal patterns, and airport preferences. Using Python for data analysis and visualization, the project highlights the impact of external factors (e.g., COVID-19) and identifies trends that are critical for stakeholders in the tourism industry.

## **Project Features**

**Data Cleaning:**

1) Handled missing values using fillna(0).
2) Standardized column names by removing unnecessary spaces.
3) Converted non-numeric values to numeric for analysis.
4) Merged datasets for comprehensive insights.

**Analysis Dimensions:**

1) Country-wise Visitors: Yearly and quarterly trends.
2) Age Groups: Dominance of specific demographics in tourism.
3) Gender Distribution: Increasing trends in female travelers.
4) Travel Methods: Preference for air travel over other methods.
5) Airport Insights: Visitor arrivals at major Indian airports.
6) State-wise Trends: Top states for tourism and regional patterns.

**Forecasting:**

Developed time-series models to predict future visitor numbers with considerations for seasonal trends and external events.

## **Key Insights**
**Quarterly Visitor Patterns:**

Peak Season: The 4th quarter (Oct-Dec) of 2019 recorded the highest visitors (2.21 million).
Secondary Peak: 1st quarter (Jan-Mar) consistently showed strong visitor counts.
Off-Peak Periods: 2nd and 3rd quarters (April-September) reflected lower counts.

**Age Group Analysis:**

Dominant Groups: 35-44 years (8.47 million) and 25-34 years (8.29 million).
Least Represented: Children (0-14 years, 2.74 million) and elderly (65+, 2.83 million).
Gender Distribution:

Female visitors showed consistent growth (2014-2019), reflecting societal changes and improved accessibility.
Male and female visitor trends remained similar, suggesting equal influence of external factors.
Travel Methods:

Significant growth in air travel, while rail and sea travel remained stable.
COVID-19 led to a sharp decline in visitor numbers in 2020.
Airport Preferences:

Delhi and Mumbai: Major hubs for international travelers.
Kolkata: Decline due to dependency on Southeast Asian passengers.
Hyderabad and Bengaluru: Primarily domestic and business travelers.
